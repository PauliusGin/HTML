    <h3>HTML tags on text arrangement, style, color. Design a page which looks like the text given <br>
        below.</h3>

    <h1 class="justify">Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h1>

    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>

    <hr>

    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>

    <h2>header size</h2>

<section>
        <p>
            and 
            <span class="blue">color</span> 
            <span class="red">of</span> 
            <span class="green">letters</span> 
            seen on the screen. The
            <span class="large">font size</span>
            can be changed as <br>
            well, and actually gives more choices.
        </p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing <br>
    word types in a blocked quote.
  </p>
</section>

<p>
    <span>Now is the</span>
    <i>time</i>
    for all good
    <strong>people</strong>
    to
    <strong>come</strong>
    to the
    <i>aid</i>
    of their country.
</p>

<p>
 That was also an example of a nested command.
